Elixir is a young programming language originally conceived by Jos√© Valim in the early 2011. It is built on top of the Erlang VM which is famous for its concurrent design, scalability, and fault-tolerance. I have been actively participating in Elixir's development since the end of March 2012, contributing to the language's core, standard library, documentation, and <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/blog/" target="blank">blog.</a></p>
