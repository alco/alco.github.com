# What is Elixir?

** Erlang VM **
** Less code **
** More fun **

Commentary:
Elixir has a property that people who start using it feel an unexplained sense of joy and pleasure. Programmers that come from Ruby describe this feeling as similar to the one they had when first started using Ruby.
Dave Thomas

Elixir has drawn some inspiration for its syntax from Ruby. But don't let that mislead you: Elixir is nothing like Ruby when it comes to semantics.

---

# In a nutshell

* Functional
* Immutable data
* Builtin concurrency
* Easily distributed

---

# What's inside?

* Erlang VM (Commentary: VM vs the language, not the same thing)
* Modern syntax
* Protocols (runtime polymorphism)
* Macros

# Erlang VM

   +--------+   +--------+
   | Erlang |   | Elixir |
   +--------+   +--------+
       ||           ||
       \/           \/
     +-----------------+
     | .beam byte code |
     +-----------------+
             ||
             \/
+---------------------------+
| BEAM emulator (Erlang VM) |
+---------------------------+

* Same byte code
* Same VM
* Same runtime environment
* Seamless interoperability

# Why Elixir?

* No repetitive boilerplate (thanks to macros)

* No duplicate APIs (thanks to protocols)

* DSLs

---

** Elixir == PRODUCTIVITY **

---

# Why Elixir?

* User friendly (syntax; exceptions; REPL)

* Tools (mix, ExUnit, EEx)

* New standard library (with awesome features)

* Enthusiastic community

---

** Elixir == FUN ***

---

# What does it look like?

*** Demo time! ***

    Create a new project with Mix.

    Show 'mix test'.

    Add HTTPotion.

    Show HTTP request with 'mix run'.

    *OR*

    Add jazz.

    Encode and decode some JSON.

---

# What just happened

** Easy to start: mix to the rescue **

 <code>

** jazz: simple API **

 <code>

** jazz: extensible API **
